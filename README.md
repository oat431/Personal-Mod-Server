# Personal Minecraft Mod Server

Saving memory with my friend, and my server experiment for open Minecraft server in some day.

## Guide if you want to open the server yourself

1. setup your server (recommended 4 to 8 Gbs Ram server)

2. set up firewall by allowed port 25565/tcp (Minecraft server default port)

3. install java SDK 21 or above

4. clone this repo

5. change the directory to the repo and run the command "java -jar server.jar --nogui."

6. give your public IPv4 to your friend and let's play!!

my personal recommendation is Azure Virtual machine 8 Gbs and picks the nearest region of your (I choose Singapore)

Now it on 1.21.11 Fabric server launcher

## To run the minecraft server

`java -Xms4G -Xmx4G -jar server.jar --nogui`
